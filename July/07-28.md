Welcome to Singapore.
This city is a <melting pot of ethnicities.> <種族的熔爐>
There is no <shortage of diversity.> <多元化的缺乏>
and good food, for that matter.
<At first glance> <第一眼> the city seems <ultra modern> <超現代> and cosmopolitan,
but when you <dig a little deeper> <深入一點挖掘> you'll notice <意識到> it's <held onto> <根基> its traditional and culture.
We've got a lot to see and explore. - (Why this mean in the future?)
All right, here we go.
The Singapore Flyer is huge.
We can see every thing, all of the skyscrapers, the bay.
Singapore is beautiful, especially from this high up.
I can see the Gardens by the Bay with the Conservatory, and the Sky trees.
Gardens by the Bay is Singapore's premiere urban outdoor <recreation space> <休閒空間>,
with over 250 <acres> <英畝> of garden.
Whoa !
Loot at this waterfall !
<Cruising along> <漫遊> the Singapore River you see the <contrast between> <兩者差異> the <colonial buildings> <殖民風格> on one side,
and the modern skyscrapers on the other.
So <Clarke Quay> <克拉碼頭> is the <hip and happening part of Singapore> <紙醉金迷>, because of its nightlife, and its restaurants.
You haven't seen Singapore if you haven't seen the Raffles Hotel.
It is such an iconic part of the city. And it's home to the Long Bar, where you can have the Singapore Sling.
Cheers ! Cheers.
The Singapore <Night Safari> <夜間野生動物園> is a one of a kind experience.
I just love how you can see all of these animals that only come out at night.
They're nocturnal, and this is the best way to see them.
There's no experience like this.
Little India is such a unique little place.
You feel like you are in India.
You can smell the food.
There's color, the people, it's just so vibrant.
It's not a great city unless it has a Chinatown.
Going through all the little <market stalls> <市場小攤販>, eating traditional Chinese food, and then taking a trishaw through Chinatown.
Woo hoo !
The <cable car> <纜車> <over to> <到達> Sentosa Island only <takes about> <花費> 15 minutes, and the views are spectacular.
We're here, let's explore !
I am <surrounded by fish> <被魚環繞> in this tunnel.
We have a such fun time here in Singapore.
From parks, to culture, to gardens, this city really does have something for everybody.
