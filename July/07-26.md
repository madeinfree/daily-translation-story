```
Our brains are designed to worry, and they're good at it.
我們的大腦擅長產生煩惱。

They're built to determine the next big thing to 'fix'.
This is great thing. It is because of this cognitive feature that we have evolved the way we have.
We developed every major industry(agriculture, medicine, religion) out of some kind of fear. Death, disorder, starvation, meaninglessness.
The part of the brain that controls rumination also controls creativity.
There is no coincidence in this.
它們生於判斷要解決的事情，這是一件好事。因為有這個認知能力，成為我們不斷演變的方法。
人們不畏懼的發展了各種重要的工業(農業、醫療、宗教)。死亡、混亂、飢餓、虛度。
腦有一部分的腦控制了沈思，也有一部分控制創造。這絕對不是巧合。

So if you feel like you can't stop worrying, can't stop creating problems for yourself,
shift your anxiety from one corner of your life to the next, it's not because there's something wrong with you.
There is only something wrong with your understanding of the human brain and happiness.
所以如果你感覺你無法停止煩惱，不斷產生煩惱，當你生活陷入絕境時換個角度想，
不能只是閒置、享受、感覺很好很快樂，這也不代表你錯了。僅僅是因為對於人的大腦和幸福有些誤解。

We weren't built to be 'happy' in the way that we think of happiness -- carefree, grateful, excited.
我們沒有去建造快樂，而我們覺得幸福就是無憂無慮、感激、興奮。

We were born to survive, which is to create.
生命就是一種創造。

Suffering dissolves when we focus on creating rather than feeling.
Instead of being at the whim of how the world makes us feel, we focus on how we can create what we want from what exists.
當我們專注於創造而不是情緒時就能化解痛苦，
然而的是世界給予我們什麼樣的感覺，
我們如何從生命中創造我們所希望。

Good and bad become irrelevant when the focus isn't 'what can I enjoy' but 'what can I create?'
當我們不再專注在「怎麼才能享受」而是「該怎麼創造」時，好與壞頓時變得無關緊要。

Obstacles become opportunities. Life becomes an incredible journey.
將絆腳石變成機會，生活變成奇妙的旅程。

Everything is creative. You are creating cells and thoughts as you read this.
任何事情都是創造。當你閱讀這篇時，你正在創造細胞與思考。

You are creating Co2 as you exhale.
當你呼吸時，你在創造二氧化碳。

Every time you spend time with someone you love, you are creating your relationship.
當你花時間與某人戀愛時，你正在創造感情。

Every time you work, you are creating money, you are creating skill.
當你正在工作時，你在創造金錢、技能。

You are always creating.
你總是在創造。

Suffering is what happens when you stop creating.
痛苦的發生是在當你停止創造以後。

Rather than devise the next step for your life, you ruminate on the last one.
當你停下來思考最後一步，而不是再思考著生活的下一步。

Rather than imagine previously inconceivable opportunities, you assume nothing better is possible.
當你認為不會再更好，而不是再思考著以前所無法想像的機會。

Rather than taking control of your life, you assume an attitude of powerlessness.
當你認為你無能為力，而不再去決定自己的生活。

You become helpless. Your suffering, meaninglessness.
你會變得無助。你會痛苦，無意義。

When our focus is on creating, pain becomes an integral part of the process.
It's 'worth it'. We're no longer dividing our emotional experiences between 'things that feel good to the senses', and 'thing that aren't.'
We're diving it into 'things that are worthwhile' and 'things that aren't.'
We're being discerning about discomfort. We're evolving and growing.
We're expanding our capacity to cope, think, love, be.
當我們專注於創造時，痛苦會變成成長的一部份。是值得的。
不應該透過我們情緒的經驗而常常陷入「這事情感覺很好」跟「這事情不好」之間。
而是應該陷入在「這事情是值得的」與「這事情不是值得的」之間。
我們是分辨適不適合。
我們演進與成長。
我們增進我們的容忍去接受。想，愛，成為。

Creativity is not exclusive to the arts, as we tend to think of it.
Everything is creative. Every last second and part of your life.
Creativity is not necessarily a burst of emotional passion, it can be a habituated choice.
創造不僅僅只是我們所想像的美術。
任何事情都是創造。
任何最後一秒與生活中的每一部分。
創造不一定需要很濃厚激烈的因素，它可以只是個習慣。

In that choice, there is a different kind of happiness, one that is not passive, but active.
Instead of trying to reap the benefits and joy out of the world other people have created,
we embark on our true mission, which is to create ourselves in the world.
That is how we leave a lasting impression.
在那個選擇，有各種不同的幸福，他是主動而不是被動的。
我們也應該要替自己做些事情，去創造自己的價值，
而不僅只是為這世界其他創造的人高興、歡呼與享受好處。這將會是我們最後離開時賦予我們的印象。

That is how we find real, deep, sustainable happiness -- in creating what is inside of us on the outside.
這都是我們如何找到真實並深入，要持續著幸福就是要創造我們那內心外面的世界。
