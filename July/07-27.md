If you had asked 22-year-old me what my "career aspirations" were, I would have looked at you blankly and then -
casually changed the subject to what programs you'd recommend to model cute 3D bunnies for a video game, or whether -
the writers of Alias would be so devious as to ship Sydney Bristow and Sark.
如果你問我22歲時的"職業理想"，我會茫然的看著你並且隨意的改變主題像是你有推薦的程式做出可愛的3D兔子在電視遊戲上或是
Sydney Bristow 和 Sark 是否像 Alias 所寫的一樣如此曲折。

It's not that I didn't think about my career at all.
這並不代表我沒有思考我的職業。

I was ambitious - I wanted to be a part of something big.
我有很大的志向，我希望在每個部分都很精通。

I wanted to be able to support myself financially and not worry my parents (as this was a high bar set at doctor, -
aka the "stablest of all professions," I suspect they still secretly worry about this.)
我希望我能有經濟能力顧好我自己，不讓親人擔心（ 像是醫生，又稱「最穩定的職業」，但我猜他們還是會默默擔心。 ）

I wanted the kind of job where I wouldn't be watching the clock every hour, daydreaming like Rebecca Black about Friday.
我希望有個工作可以不需要每小時看著時間，可以像 Rebecca Black about Friday 一樣。

But beyond that, the specifics of "think about my career" was a giant grey cloud to me.
除此之外，對我來說，想像我的職業非常的迷惘。

It felt almost icky to be too career-oriented, like if you were, you were that kind of self-absorbed person constantly -
trying to game the system by sugar-coating the things you said to your bosses.
這種太過於職業導向令人討厭，你會不斷的想盡辦法討好你的老闆，當你是這種人時。

Beside, at 22, I had taken my first job at a start-up where we were moving way too fast to sit down and idly contemplate -
the skill we hoped to learn.
此外，在我 22 歲時，我在一間發展很快速到無法停下來好好思考我該學習什麼的新創公司。

Who needs career conversations when you're busy changing the world ?
在你忙於改變世界時，誰還會需要談論職業？

Here's the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not.
If you don't think about it, then you're putting faith in the winds. Maybe you'll end up somewhere you've always -
wanted to go. Maybe not, Why take that chance when you can captain your own sails ?
不過這有一些建議：將人生化為一種職業，不論你是否認同。 如果你不這麼想，這股信念就像一陣風，你到哪裡停止了，你就想走了。
但也不一定，為什麼不試著轉舵當你可以領航你自己的時候呢？
